# Ethereal_Extras
Things I randomly think should have been included in the Ethereal Mod by tenplus1 for Minetest.

Some of the items added do not exist at the time of upload in Ethereal mod, such as orange tree wood. Instead the mod uses default tree wood.
You will have to update your mod file to point to these images instead of the default images if you want to use these instead.

I like the Sakura tree that tenplus1 made, but I wanted another variation that resulted in a pink wood and resembled the other beautiful tree woods that I love in the mod (healing, scortched, and frost) so I created my own version.
